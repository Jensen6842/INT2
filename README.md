# Software 3: Functional Programming with Applications

## Description
This module advances the IS stream by introducing the basics of machine learning, purely from an optimisation perspective. <br />
The range of topics covers linear regression (picking up where Data 1 left off) to decision trees and a simple neural network (leading into advanced machine learning in the third year). <br />
Understanding ML requires knowledge of some mathematical concepts that build upon A-level standard mathematics, specifically: Linear Algebra and Continuous Optimisation.
This will be taught in-place. <br />
Students will see motivating real world problems, the ML techniques required to solve them, the underlying mathematics needed for the technique and their practical implementation. <br />
Practicals will be taught using a python-based modern machine learning library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch and so students will gain experience with the declarative programming paradigm (building on the Software stream). <br />
